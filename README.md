# L0V3L0rN: Demo
L0V3L0rN is aims to be turn-based RPG, that is heavily story-driven. The spurner wakes up after a night of drinking & trying to forget. His head in pain and hallucinating, he tries to get up for the day. It's only when he fully wakes up is where he finds himself more and more deep into a sinking world where only l0v3 of the purest kind exists.

With this around 5-10 minute demo gameplay, only a small portion of its story and world is shown.
