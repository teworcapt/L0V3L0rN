# L0V3L0rN
L0V3L0rN is aims to be turn-based RPG, that is heavily story-driven. The spurner wakes up after a night of forgetting, head in pain, and almost hallucinating, he tries to get up; but as he continues on, he finds himself more and more deep into a sinking world where only l0v3 of the purest kind exists.
